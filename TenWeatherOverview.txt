1. Frontend Architecture

Technologies

React 18 (UI framework) + Vite (build tool)

Tailwind CSS for responsive styling

Framer Motion for smooth animations

Lucide React for dynamic weather icons

Axios for API calls

(Optional) Three.js / React Three Fiber for 3D visualizations

Lottie React for animated loaders

Core Components

App.jsx → Manages global state, geolocation, API calls, and renders backgrounds/UI.

SearchBar.jsx / LocationSuggestions.jsx → Smart input (city or coordinates) with debounced suggestions.

WeatherBackground.jsx / SatelliteMapBackground.jsx → Animated or 3D weather visual layers.

WeatherIcon.jsx → Maps weather codes to icons with motion and glow effects.

Weather Cards (Current, Hourly, Weekly, Details) → Responsive displays of weather data with motion transitions.
